# Immich_Setup
This Immich setup will combine docker-compose.yml, hwaccel.ml.yml and hwaccel.transcoding.yml into a single docker-compose file.
Put the docker-compose and 1.env file to the same location as to where you want Immich to store the uploaded images and library etc.
Remane the 1.env file to .env
